    "Script to update the music listening history table to include the artist and album IDs from Spotify. These values are not populated in the files provided by Spotify, and must be accessed via the API. Also handles naturally occurring duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script performs the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize logging and establish a connection to the database.\n",
    "2. Update the music listening history with artist and album ID. \n",
    "3. Process duplicate artists, appending a numerical suffix to artists with the same name and less followers throughout the database.\n",
    "4. Execute queries to update the track mapping and consolidated tracks tables. Combine tracks with the same name but different IDs. The song lengths must be within 3 seconds of each other, and the sort order is album version > single > compilation. \n",
